* Upgrade Notes
  + Package names of classes in zpoi.jar are renamed from org.apache.poi.* to org.zkoss.poi.* to avoid class 
    name conflicts with of those in poi.jar, so it is now OK to put both zpoi.jar and poi.jar in class path.
  + Spec. of Range#getColumn(), Range#getRow(), Range#getLastColumn(), Range#getLastRow(), Range#getCells() has 
    changed from 1-based to 0-based so it consists with other APIs. That is, in new spec, Range#getColumn() 
	return 0 for column A (1st column) and Range#getRow() return 0 for row 1 (1st row).
  + Spreadsheet#getSelectedSheet() return org.zkoss.zss.model.Worksheet
  + Methods range(org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Sheet sheet, ...) in org.zkoss.zss.model.Ranges changed signature 
    to range(org.zkoss.zss.model.Worksheet sheet, ...)
