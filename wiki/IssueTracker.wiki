#ZK Spreadsheet Issue Tracker

The ZK Spreadsheet team has moved the issue tracker from Google Code to our own system at http://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/ZSS. Please adopt to the new system.

Users are able to log into the new system using their ZK forum account. If you do not already have one, please register at http://www.zkoss.org/forum/

Our new system on Jira introduces a new and very powerful voting system enabling users to vote up for a desired new feature or a bug that other users also have problem encountering.
